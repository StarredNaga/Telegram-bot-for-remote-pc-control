2. Send commands to your bot in format: `/command`
3. Commands execute immediately or prompt for required parameters

1. Create new class implementing `ICommand` interface (for example shutdown command)
2. The framework automatically discovers and registers your command at startup

## Configuration

Modify Configurations.json to customize behavior:

### Core Settings

```json
"System": {
    "Terminal": "path to terminal"
    // Linux application paths (e.g., "nmap": "/usr/bin/nmap")
}
```
### Telegram Settings

```json
"TelegramBot": {
    "Token": "Bot token here"
  }
```

### Security Policies

```json
"Security": {

    "AllowedUsers": [chat id's here],

    "CommandPermissions": {
      "shutdown": [ chat id's here ]
    }
  }
```
* **User Permissions**: Add users by Chat ID with specific command access
* **Command Security**: Unlisted commands are executable by all authorized users
* **If the command does not have user IDs specified, then anyone who is allowed to use the command can use it**
